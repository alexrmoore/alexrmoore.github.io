        <ul>
            <li>Established the principle of interference of light. <br><br></li>
            <li>Resurrected the wave theory of light. <br><br></li>
            <li>Young allowed light to pass through two closely set holes in a screen. <br>Young found that light beams spread apart and overlapped. <br>In the areas of overlap, bands of alternating bright light and darkness <br>can be observed. This was explained by the light waves constructively <br>and destructively interfering respectively. <br><br></li>
